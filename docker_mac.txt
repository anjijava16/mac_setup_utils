Problem :
welcome@welcomes-MacBook-Pro ~ % docker run hello-world
docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/welcome/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/docker.raw.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.
See 'docker run --help'.



# Fix:
Go to Spotlight Search,
Type: Docker and open the App
You would see it on your Apple Menu bar,
Make sure you see: "Docker is running"
